# Contributing Guidelines

Interested in contributing to the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)?
Awesome! Read this document to understand how to report issues, contribute
features and participate in the development process. We want to create a
transparent and open process for evolving AWS SAM.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.

## Integrating AWS SAM into your tool

We encourage you to modify SAM to integrate it with other frameworks and deployment providers from the community for building serverless applications. If you're building a new tool that will use AWS SAM, let us know how we can help!

## Submitting feature requests

We love features that help developers build serverless applications faster and further simplify development of serverless applications. If you have ideas for new event sources, new resource types, and new parameters within SAM, follow these steps to submit your feature request:

1. Scan through the list
   of
   [feature requests](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/labels/type/feature).
   If you find your feature there, mark it +1. This is a good indication of
   interest from the community.
2. If you don't find your feature in our backlog, create a new issue and assign
   the `Feature Request` label to it.

Keep in mind that features should be driven by real use cases. Answer the
following questions in the issue that you create:

- Does this feature simplify creating and deploying some aspect of a serverless application?
- Is this feature solving a problem faced by other serverless application developers?
- How do developers work around this problem today?
- How is the proposed feature better than the work around?

## Adding features to AWS SAM

We welcome pull requests to add new features to AWS SAM. Take a look at the
backlog of [Feature Requests](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-specification/labels/feature-request) and pick an item that you find interesting. If the requirements have been well-scoped, feel free to make the change and send a pull request.

If you don't find an item tracking what you have in mind, start a conversation with your plan for implementing
the feature. When defining your feature, keep in mind that one of the core
tenets of AWS SAM is to keep it easy to use while allowing customers access to
use more advanced components, should they so choose.

This repository contains the SAM specification, the code that translates SAM templates into AWS CloudFormation stacks, general information about the model, and examples of common applications. Make enhancements to all of SAM: if you make a change to the specification, please also make the corresponding change to the implementation.

Here are some questions that you should answer in your plan:

- **What is the problem you are solving?**

    Example: Creating API endpoints require 24 steps, most of which are boilerplate and repetitive.

- **Describe persona of someone who is facing this problem? This will give you
    an understanding of how big of a problem it actually is.**

    Example: John just finished coding bootcamp and wants to create a Serverless app. He has
    basic coding skills and will be comfortable understanding infrastructure
    concepts, but probably be intimidated by the 24 steps required to create an
    API endpoint.

- **How do developers work around this problem today?**

    Example: Manually click through every step on the website while referring to
    "How To" resources on the internet.

- **Describe your proposed solution?**

    Example: We are creating a new AWS SAM resource called "API". Here is how it
    will look:

    ```yaml
    Type: 'AWS::Serverless::Api'
    Properties:
        # Name of API endpoint
        Name: <string>
        # Path to their endpoint. Example: /hello
        Path: <string>
        # HTTP Method for their endpoint. Example: GET, POST etc
        Method: <string>
    ```

- **How is the proposed feature better than what the work around?**

    Example: Developers can write a simple AWS SAM resource which will handle
    generating the boilerplate for them.

## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check [existing open](https://github.com/awslabs/PRIVATE-aws-sam-development/issues), or [recently closed](https://github.com/awslabs/PRIVATE-aws-sam-development/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20), issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already
reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

- A reproducible test case or series of steps
- The version of our code being used
- Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
- Anything unusual about your environment or deployment

## Contributing via Pull Requests

Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the *develop* branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted.
4. You propose complete changes - if you make a change to the specification, please also make the corresponding change to the implementation.

To send us a pull request, please:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for us to focus on your change.
3. Ensure local tests pass.
4. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.
5. Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.
6. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation.

GitHub provides additional document on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

## Finding contributions to work on

Looking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute on. As our projects, by default, use the default GitHub issue labels ((enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix), looking at any ['help wanted'](https://github.com/awslabs/PRIVATE-aws-sam-development/labels/help%20wanted) issues is a great place to start.
