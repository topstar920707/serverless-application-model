class SamPlugins(object):
    """
    Class providing support for arbitrary plugins that can extend core SAM translator in interesting ways.
    Use this class to register plugins that get called when certain life cycle events happen in the translator.
    Plugins work only on resources that are natively supported by SAM (ie. AWS::Serverless::* resources)

    Following Life Cycle Events are available:

    **Resource Level**
    - before_transform_resource: Invoked before SAM translator processes a resource's properties.
    - [Coming Soon] after_transform_resource

    **Template Level**
    - before_transform_template
    - after_transform_template

    When a life cycle event happens in the translator, this class will invoke the corresponding "hook" method on the
    each of the registered plugins to process. Plugins are free to modify internal state of the template or resources
    as they see fit. They can even raise an exception when the resource or template doesn't contain properties
    of certain structure (Ex: Only PolicyTemplates are allowed in SAM template)

    ## Plugin Implementation

    ### Defining a plugin
    A plugin is a subclass of `BasePlugin` that implements one or more methods capable of processing the life cycle
    events.
    These methods have a prefix `on_` followed by the name of the life cycle event. For example, to  handle
    `before_transform_resource` event, implement a method called `on_before_transform_resource`. We call these methods
    as "hooks" which are methods capable of handling this event.

    ### Hook Methods
    Arguments passed to the hook method is different for each life cycle event. Check out the hook methods in the
    `BasePlugin` class for detailed description of the method signature

    ### Raising validation errors
    Plugins must raise an `samtranslator.model.exception.InvalidResourceException` when the input SAM template does
    not conform to the expectation
    set by the plugin. SAM translator will convert this into a nice error message and display to the user.
